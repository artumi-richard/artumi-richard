# About @artumi-richard

I am UK based generally available to hire as a web-developer on a freelance basis, under by VAT registered Limited
company. I am married to and work with @artumi-mandy

[www.artumi.com](https://www.artumi.com)

## Technical abilities

I'm a PHP full stack developer with 20 years experience, so: PHP, Laravel, Javascript, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Linux Admin,
Ansible, and many commercial APIs (eBay, Stripe, Slack, Couriers, 3PL)

## People skills

I've run Artumi Systems Ltd in the UK since 2013 (and as a sole trader since 2006), which has meant having skills in sales and project management, and so
on, all involving good clear communication with customers.

## Interests

I want to help reduce the mental health and  loneliness crises by promoting the formation of clubs and societies with my
website [www.clublaunchpad.com](https://www.clublaunchpad.com)

I'm keen on our planet! I like walking. I'm the chair of [Sheffield Environment
Weeks](https://www.sheffield-environment.org) and I'm a member of
[Sheffield Conservation Volunteers](https://www.sheffieldconservation.org)

I like travelling, and went with my family in the summer of 2025 on a bit of a tour of Europe, visiting the Netherlands,
Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium. We liked visiting mainland Europe before, but it's really deepened our love
of all the cultures we got to see, and the people we met.

## Key Technical Achievements

I've built custom e-commerce sites that manage many £millions of revenue per year.

I've built Courier management systems,  CPD and E-learning systems, Collaboration platforms, and more.

I am fairly active on the [dotswan/filament-map-picker](https://github.com/dotswan/filament-map-picker) plugin, and
managed to get a couple of Pull Requests into the core Laravel framework  [57148](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/57148)
and [54340](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/54340) which I am chuffed with.

## What next?

Please drop me an email to <richard@artumi.com> if you to talk about Work, Club Launchpad, my European trip, or anything
else I've mentioned that floats your boat.
